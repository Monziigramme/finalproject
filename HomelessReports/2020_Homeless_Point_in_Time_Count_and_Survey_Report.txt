Parenting Youth
In 2020, 124 of the 506 homeless families were
parenting youth households (parents or legal
guardians of children who were not accompanied
by an adult household member over age 24). The
130 parenting youth were all between the ages of
18 and 24 and 127 of them were sheltered (See
Figure 11). These families had 182 children for a
combined total of 312 persons living in households
headed by parenting youth, which was a 5.2
percent decrease from last year. As Figures 12 and
13 illustrate, parenting youth experiencing
homelessness were overwhelmingly female and
Black/African American.

Of the 3,668 homeless persons not living in
families, 3,654 were adults over the age of 24. The
remaining 9 percent of these homeless individuals
were age 18-24.

The racial composition of homeless individuals not
in families mirrors that of the overall population.
Approximately 75 percent were Black/African
American and 23 percent were White. More than
73 percent of homeless persons not in families
were male, a rate which was relatively consistent
across racial groups. 19 people – about 0.5 percent
– identified as transgender or gender non-
conforming (See Figure 16).

Over the past five years, the number of people experiencing homelessness in Chicago on a given night in
January has decreased by 21%. However, in 2020 that figure ticked slightly upward – an increase of 2% from
5,290 in 2019 to 5,390 in 2020. The number of people experiencing homelessness counted in shelters has
been in decline since 2014 and decreased by 4 percent compared to 2019. However, in unsheltered locations
(including encampments, 24-hour establishments, CTA trains and buses), the number counted has fluctuated
from lower than 1,000 to a high of 2,055 in 2015. This year’s count in unsheltered locations of 1,529 was 21
percent higher than the 1,260 counted in 2019, but still represents a 26 percent decrease since 2015.

Black people continue to be overrepresented in the population experiencing homelessness in Chicago. While
about one-third of Chicago’s total population is Black/African American, 77 percent of the homeless
population are Black/African American.

2020 also marked the sixth year that the number of families experiencing homelessness decreased. The
number of families in shelter has decreased steadily since 2014 by 36 percent and youth-headed families have
decreased by more than 30 percent since DFSS began tracking parenting youth in 2016.

The number of single person households in shelter rose by 5 percent to 2,161 but remained 21% lower than
its all-time high in 2014 at 2,748. At the same time, the number of unsheltered homeless single persons, 1,507,
increased significantly (19%), which may in part be explained by dramatically different weather conditions on
the night of this year’s count compared to 2019 and increased volunteer presence for counting on the CTA.
The vulnerability of the unsheltered population has increased slightly based on reported rates of physical
disabilities, substance use, and mental illness. Given the age of unsheltered homeless persons, 60% over the
age of 40, the homeless persons found on the street are more at risk than ever.

The PIT Count is only one measurement used to gauge progress in preventing and ending homelessness. It
cannot capture the experience of all individuals and families experiencing homelessness in Chicago in a given
year. However, along with HMIS data and data collected through the year from service providers and persons
with lived experience, it provides critical information in helping the City, the CoC, and many partners make
progress on the shared goal of making homelessness rare, brief, and non-recurring.

APPENDIX A: SAMPLE WEIGHTING

 The shelter survey data, which is a sample, was extrapolated based on sample weights constructed relative to
 the shelter/program response rate. Although each shelter was instructed to interview 10 percent of all clients
 on the night of the PIT count, practical considerations in many instances result in a smaller or larger percentage
 of all residents being interviewed. To account for this variation, shelter-level weights were constructed in order
 to ensure that the representation of persons staying in each shelter during the 2018 count, relative to all shelter
 residents, is correct. This method allows for inclusion of all surveys collected in producing estimated
 percentages and reduces the impact of over and under sampled sites (i.e. more or less than ten percent).

 The following procedure was used to construct these weights:
 1. The selection probabilities (f) for each shelter were first estimated: f = (n / N); where: n = total persons
 interviewed within the shelter; and N = total tally of persons staying in the shelter the night of the count.
 2. Expansion weights (we) for each shelter were next estimated as the reciprocal of the selection
 probabilities: we = (N / n).
 3. Relative weights (wr) for each shelter were subsequently constructed as their expansion weight divided by
 the mean of all expansion weights: wr= [(we / (Σ we / n)].
 4. Those persons interviewed outside of shelter settings were assigned a value of 1.0 for their relative weight,
 as were those persons interviewed in a small number of shelters for which a complete tally was not available.
