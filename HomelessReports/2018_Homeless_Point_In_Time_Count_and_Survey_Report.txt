ACCESS TO SERVICES
Following the trend from the past few years, access
to Medicaid/Medicare and LINK/Food Stamp usage
continued to improve for the unsheltered
population, while there was a decline in both
among the sheltered population. (See Figure 40)

homeless adults reporting access to services

Location of Unsheltered Homeless
When asked where they were going to stay the
evening of the count, half of the unsheltered survey
respondents said they intended to stay anywhere
outside which was up 10 percent from 2017. This
high response this year may again be attributed to
the unseasonal warmth seen the day of the PIT
count. At the same time, 19 percent were planning
to stay on a CTA train/bus while another 8 percent
reported an abandoned building or vacant unit.
Other options included spending the night in an
emergency room (6.5%) or police station (2.6%).

CONCLUSION

Last year Chicago identified the lowest total number of homeless persons in over ten years. In 2018 that
figure decreased again by another 4 percent. This year marks the lowest number of sheltered and
unsheltered homeless persons since Chicago has undertaken a PIT. Shelter bed availability has remained
fairly flat; however the number of sheltered persons has been on the decline since 2014. On the street, the
number counted has fluctuated from lower than 1,000 to a high of 2,055 in 2015. This year’s street count in
comparison to 2015 when it was at its all-time highest is 34% decrease.
2018 also marked the fourth year that the rate of sheltered families decreased. Families in shelters has decreased
steadily since 2015 by 28 percent and youth-headed families decreased by 30 percent since DFSS has tracked the
parenting youth in 2016. Another decline is the average family size which fell to 3.36 from 3.45 in 2017. The
number of single households in shelter rose slightly to 2,196 but is 20% lower than its all-time high in 2014 at
2,748.

For the past few PIT counts, Chicago has seen a rise of street homelessness in specific areas. Similar to findings in
2016 and 2017, this year’s results show that locations where unsheltered homeless persons are found continue to
shift over time. This year, communities in the downtown area experienced a great increase whereas along the
lakefront has declined. DFSS and its partnering agencies and stakeholders have dedicated significant resources to
engage and house homeless encampment participants from areas along the lakefront. See Appendix B for
unsheltered data by community area and ward.

Based on the survey, the proportion of those that said they would sleep outdoors rose an additional 10% from 40
percent to 50 percent in 2018. Meanwhile, the percent of characteristics that relate the vulnerability of this
population all increased: physical disabilities, substance use, and mental illness. Coupled with that the age of
homeless persons has increased both in the 41-60 and over 60 ranges, the homeless persons found on the street
are more at risk than ever.

The Chicago Coordinated Entry System (CES) incorporates a universal standardized assessment for all homeless
populations to be entered into HMIS. The system was fully implemented in 2017 to act as the communication tool
used by outreach and service providers to connect to housing opportunities. The disjointed and confounding
points of entry into permanent housing programs will eventually be eliminated creating a navigational entryway
that prioritizes the most vulnerable for effective and appropriate housing. The PIT is one measurement that will
be used to gauge the CoC’s progress over time and its effect on reducing the duration of homelessness.

APPENDIX A: SAMPLE WEIGHTING

The shelter survey data, which is a sample, was extrapolated based on sample weights constructed relative to
the shelter/program response rate. Although each shelter was instructed to interview 10 percent of all clients
on the night of the PIT count, practical considerations in many instances result in a smaller or larger percentage
of all residents being interviewed. To account for this variation, shelter-level weights were constructed in order
to ensure that the representation of persons staying in each shelter during the 2018 count, relative to all
shelter residents, is correct. This method allows for inclusion of all surveys collected in producing estimated
percentages and reduces the impact of over and under sampled sites (i.e. more or less than ten percent).

The following procedure was used to construct these weights:
1. The selection probabilities (f) for each shelter were first estimated: f = (n / N); where: n = total persons
interviewed within the shelter; and N = total tally of persons staying in the shelter the night of the count.
2. Expansion weights (we) for each shelter were next estimated as the reciprocal of the selection probabilities:
we = (N / n).
3. Relative weights (wr) for each shelter were subsequently constructed as their expansion weight divided by
the mean of all expansion weights: wr= [(we / (Σ we / n)].
4. Those persons interviewed outside of shelter settings were assigned a value of 1.0 for their relative weight,
as were those persons interviewed in a small number of shelters for which a complete tally was not available.
