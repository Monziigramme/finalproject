CONCLUSION
The total number of homeless persons identified in
the 2016 Point-in-Time Count is the lowest figure in
over ten years. Figures for the both the sheltered
and unsheltered population decreased from last
year. There are likely many factors contributing
to this decrease. The drop in the unsheltered
population could be attributed in part to a new
counting methodology on CTA vehicles, which has
been determined to be more accurate by focusing on
homeless persons using the lines as shelter. Chicago’s
Ending Veteran Homelessness Initiative has led to
improved identification, assessment, and matching to
housing resources, housing 2,339 veterans since 2015.
Using lessons learned from the veteran initiative,
Chicago plans to identify, assess, and create a by-name
list of chronic homeless persons on the street in order
to reduce the number of days to permanent housing.
