ACCESS TO SERVICES
Shifting from the trend from the past few years,
access to Medicaid/Medicare and LINK/Food
Stamp usage decreased for the unsheltered
population, while both increased among the
sheltered population and significantly for
Medicaid/Medicare (See Figure 41). Note that
figures represent the percentage of all homeless
adults reporting access to services regardless of
eligibility.

Location of Unsheltered Homeless
When asked where they were going to stay the
evening of the count, nearly 27 percent of the
unsheltered survey respondents said they intended
to stay anywhere outside which, was down from 50
percent from 2018. This response may again be
attributed to the cold temperatures the day of the
PIT count. At the same time, 22 percent were
planning to stay on a CTA train/bus while another
14 percent reported the police station where they
would be transported to shelter, which was up
about 11 percent from 2018. Few indicated they
would stay in an abandoned building or vacant unit
(See Figure 43).

CONCLUSION

For the past four years, Chicago’s total number of homeless persons has decreased. In 2019 that figure
decreased again by 3 percent. This year marks the lowest number of sheltered and unsheltered homeless
persons since Chicago has undertaken a PIT. Shelter bed availability has remained fairly flat; however, the
number of sheltered persons has been on the decline since 2014. On the street, the number counted has
fluctuated from lower than 1,000 to a high of 2,055 in 2015. This year’s street count was 6 percent lower
than 2018, marking a 38 percent decrease since 2015 when it was at its all-time highest.

2019 also marked the fifth year that the rate of sheltered families decreased. Families in shelters has decreased
steadily since 2014 by 29 percent and youth-headed families decreased by 34 percent since DFSS has tracked the
parenting youth in 2016. There was a slight increase in the average family size from 3.36 last year to 3.48 in 2019.
The number of single person households in shelter dropped by 8 percent, to 2,013 and was 27% lower than its
all-time high in 2014 at 2,748. At the same time, the number of unsheltered homeless single persons, 1,377,
increased slightly (3%).

For the past few PIT counts, Chicago has seen a rise of street homelessness in specific areas. Similar to findings in
2016 and 2017, this year’s results show that locations where unsheltered homeless persons are found continue to
shift over time. The highest percentage of unsheltered homeless were found in the Loop and Near West Side.
While some communities in the communities surrounding the greater downtown area saw an increase in
reported unsheltered homeless people, the Loop itself declined The cold weather of the night of the PIT drove
many unsheltered homeless to the CTA trains and resulted in the highest percentage of all homeless persons at
the O’Hare Airport station. DFSS and its partnering agencies and stakeholders have dedicated significant
resources to engage and house homeless encampments in the central business district. See Appendix B and C for
unsheltered data by community area and ward.

Based on the survey, the proportion of those that said they would sleep outdoors decreased in 2019 from half to
22 percent. Meanwhile, the vulnerability of this population has remained steady based on rates of physical
disabilities, substance use, and mental illness. Given the age of unsheltered homeless persons, many in the 41-60
and over 60 ranges, the homeless persons found on the street are more at risk than ever.

The Chicago Coordinated Entry System (CES) incorporates a universal standardized assessment for all homeless
populations to be entered into HMIS. The system was fully implemented in 2017 to act as the communication tool
used by outreach and service providers to connect to housing opportunities. The disjointed and confounding
points of entry into permanent housing programs will eventually be eliminated creating a navigational entryway
that prioritizes the most vulnerable for effective and appropriate housing. The PIT is one measurement that will
be used to gauge the CoC’s progress over time and its effect on reducing the duration of homelessness.

APPENDIX A: SAMPLE WEIGHTING

The shelter survey data, which is a sample, was extrapolated based on sample weights constructed relative to the
shelter/program response rate. Although each shelter was instructed to interview 10 percent of all clients on the
night of the PIT count, practical considerations in many instances result in a smaller or larger percentage of all
residents being interviewed. To account for this variation, shelter-level weights were constructed in order to ensure
that the representation of persons staying in each shelter during the 2018 count, relative to all shelter residents, is
correct. This method allows for inclusion of all surveys collected in producing estimated percentages and reduces
the impact of over and under sampled sites (i.e. more or less than ten percent).

The following procedure was used to construct these weights:
1. The selection probabilities (f) for each shelter were first estimated: f = (n / N); where: n = total persons
interviewed within the shelter; and N = total tally of persons staying in the shelter the night of the count.
2. Expansion weights (we) for each shelter were next estimated as the reciprocal of the selection
probabilities: we = (N / n).
3. Relative weights (wr) for each shelter were subsequently constructed as their expansion weight divided by
the mean of all expansion weights: wr= [(we / (Σ we / n)].
4. Those persons interviewed outside of shelter settings were assigned a value of 1.0 for their relative weight, as
were those persons interviewed in a small number of shelters for which a complete tally was not available.
