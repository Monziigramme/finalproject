Parenting Youth
In 2021, 100 of the 383 homeless families were
parenting youth households (parents or legal
guardians of children who were not accompanied
by an adult household member over age 24). 105 of
the 106 parenting youth were between the ages of
18 and 24 and all of them were in shelters (See
Figure 9). These families had 137 children for a
combined total of 243 persons living in households
headed by parenting youth, which was a decrease
from last year. As Figures 10 and 11 illustrate,
parenting youth experiencing homelessness were
overwhelmingly female        and Black/African
American.

Of the 2,468 people experiencing homelessness not
living in families, 91 percent were adults over the
age of 24. The remaining 9 percent of these
homeless individuals were age 18-24.

The racial and ethnic composition of individuals
experiencing homelessness not in families differs
slightly from that of the overall population.
Approximately 67 percent were Black/African
American, 11 percent were people of Hispanic or
Latino origin, and 17 percent were White Non-
Hispanic. More than 72 percent of people
experiencing homelessness not in families were
male, a rate which was relatively consistent across
racial and ethnic groups. Nine people identified as
transgender or gender non-conforming (See Figure
14).

CONCLUSION
The 2021 PIT Count looked different than previous years given the need to protect health and safety of all
involved from the spread of COVID-19. While pandemic precautions and methodology changes limit the
ability to compare this year’s results with previous years, this year’s count still provides a valuable snapshot
of people experiencing homelessness in Chicago.

The 2021 PIT Count estimated a total of 4,447 persons experiencing homelessness. The count identified 3,023
individuals experiencing homelessness residing in shelters and an estimated 702 to 1,454 people experiencing
homelessness on the street. While this year’s counts are not comparable to 2020, the proportion of people
experiencing homelessness residing in shelters (68%) versus those on the street, which includes
encampments, 24-hour establishments, and CTA trains and buses, (32%) is similar to previous years.

Black people continue to be overrepresented in the population experiencing homelessness in Chicago. While
about one-third of Chicago’s total population is Black/African American, 73 percent of the homeless
population are Black/African American.

In 2021, an estimated 383 families with children were experiencing homelessness, all residing in shelters. The
majority of these households (76%) are headed by Black females. Another 12 percent of the heads of
household in families with children are Latina. A significant portion of these heads of household are young –
27 percent are between 18 and 24 years old.

The 2021 PIT Count identified a total of 2,468 homeless people not living in families with children, including
members of adult couples and families in which every member is over 18. The racial and ethnic composition
of people in these households has remained steady compared to previous years. Almost half (48%) of single
people experiencing homelessness, or as a member of an all adult household, were Black males.

The PIT Count is only one measurement used gauge progress in preventing and ending homelessness. It cannot
capture the experience of all individuals and families experiencing homelessness in Chicago in a given year.
However, along with HMIS data and data collected through the year from service providers and persons with
lived experience, it provides critical information in helping the City, the CoC, and many partners make progress
on the shared goal of making homelessness rare, brief, and non-recurring.
